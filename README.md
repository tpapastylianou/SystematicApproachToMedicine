Condition synopsis

  * Etymology + Definition
  * Description
  * Optional: Historical background
  * (Formal) Criteria and Classifications

* * *

Epidemiology

  * Frequency
    * Incidence
    * Prevalence
    * Commonness (e.g. in terms of GP consultations or hospital admissions)
    * Mortality
  * Age of Presentation
  * Gender differences
  * Geographical Variation
  * Other specific environmental factors
  * Low- vs High-risk groups

* * *

Associations  
  
(i.e. what are the two important questions that need to be asked / aspects of
the current diagnosis and treatment, with respect to how they relate to other
conditions in an epidemiological sense?) "Assuming X is the condition under
investigation, and Y is the associated condition to be addressed:  

  * "What is the % risk that people with X have (prevalence), or are generally expected to develop (incidence) Y?" -- _Treatment / Prevention_
  

  * "What is the % risk that people with Y would already have (prevalence), or would have generally been expected to develop (incidence) X?" -- _Differential diagnosis_

* * *

Aetiology

  * Serious causes (usually rare and to be excluded)
  * Common causes
  * Surgical Sieve! (mnemonic: INVESTIGATIONS):
    *  **I** atrogenic (!)  
 _Always exclude this first: it tends to be the most common cause of modern
disease, yet typically also the most overlooked!  
(include self-treatments in this category too)_

    *  **N** eoplastic
    *  **V** ascular
    *  **E** ndocrine / Metabolic 
    * **S** tructural / Mechanical
    *  **T** raumatic / Environmental
    *  **I** nflammatory / Infective
    *  **G** enetic / Congenital
    *  **A** utoimmune
    *  **T** oxic / Self-toxic
    *  **I** maginary / Psychiatric

History : Preliminaries

  * Date, Time and Place
  * Person taking / signing history
  * Reason for history (i.e. 'admission clerking', 'asked to see patient', 'ward round' etc)
  * Name, Date of Birth (Age), Gender, Patient Details, GP's name
  * Patient's non-medical background ("Tell me a bit about yourself. [...?] Well, introduce yourself to me: What do you do, where are you from, anything in particular you'd like me to know about you as a person?")  
 _This might come off as a bit weird if not executed properly; however, when
done correctly, it establishes rapport, helps both you and the patient to see
the patient as more than the disease, it helps put this event in the context
of the human being it relates to, and can typically give useful information or
context that would not have otherwise come up during the History, e.g. their
dog is at home and the reason they're keen to self-discharge is because of the
dog; a loved one recently passed away leaving them in financial trouble; they
live in an isolated place making their emergency even scarier; they are a
celebrity who is worried about press; their living circumstances are dire but
they don't like to make a fuss; etc._

Hx: Summary

  * Summary - clarification - wrapping things up  
E.g. _"Right, I will now summarize what we've just talked about back to you,
to confirm that I got everything correctly, ok? So, you felt some pain around
8pm; this was a dull ache in the centre of the chest [...]"_ , etc.  
This achieves two things:  
 **a)** it enables you to reconstruct a fluff-free to-the-point summary of
events, which the patient can confirm/endorse, or correct if you misunderstood
something.  
 **b)** During History taking, one generally wants to ask open-ended questions
as much as possible (to avoid 'leading' the patient), and to let the patient
talk, and listen without interrupting too much. Summarising it all back to the
patient like this enables the patient to see what _your_ agenda was during
that discussion, and what _you_ were actually paying attention to, which may
be different to what the patient thought you were after. This in turn may
prompt more relevant details and clarifications.

  * After summary: "Is there anything I missed, or anything else you could think that is relevant"
  * "Any questions / comments / concerns that have not been addressed (before I start the examination)?"

* * *

Physical Examination / Clinical signs
